1: Put this code inside a script in workspace
PER SONG:
	1: Make a new sound inside the script.
	2: Set the Sound's SoundId to the song id.
	3: Edit the volume until it sounds correct.

Notes:
	I also added a skip value inside of the script incase you ever wanted to make a voteskip
	Just make it so if the number of votes exceed a certain percentage or number, make the skip value enabled (serversided).
